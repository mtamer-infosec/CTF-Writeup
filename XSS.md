# Cross-Site Scripting   (XSS)

- allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application
- allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other
- allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data
